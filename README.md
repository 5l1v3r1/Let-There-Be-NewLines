# Let There Be NewLines!
Replaces all newlines in the bio of every GitHub profile page, because seriously, why isn't this a thing yet?

![Look at those newlines](http://i.imgur.com/TLIE9kI.gif)

## What is this?
It's a chrome extension that changes the look of your profile's bio section.
GitHub sadly doesn't allow newlines in your bio, so to rebel against the system this Chrome extension was created!

## Installation
Clone the repository in a directory of choice, in Google Chrome go to: *Settings -> Extensions*, make sure the *Developer mode* checkbox is checked, click *Load unpacked extension*, navigate to the location you cloned the source code in and select the *src* folder and press *Ok*. That's it! Now update your GitHub bio and add a few nifty newlines and you're set!

## Why haven't you put it up on the Chrome store?
Releasing an extension costs an initial 5 dollars (that's two days worth of food okay), the life of a student is a life of crippling debt.
If the demand relly is so big; start a gofundme campagin so we can put our collective efforts towards making this dream a reality.
